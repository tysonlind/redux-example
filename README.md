## Simple Redux Example

#### In this example, I show how to implement simple redux storage using a single slice, store, provider, and two reducers. The state created and managed by the reducers is then used to set and modify a series of to-do items with different priorities which automatically renders a highlighted background based on the level of priority. Tasks can be added using a form
or removed using a remove button.

## Setting up the project
1. Download or fork and clone the project down. 
2. Open up the folder that houses the package.json file.
3. Run <code>npm i</code> or <code>npm install</code>
4. Use the <code>npm run dev</code> command to run the application.

### Please let me know if you found this example useful! Thanks, and happy coding!
